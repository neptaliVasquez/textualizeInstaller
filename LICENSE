[bold green]ADDI MASTER NON-COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT[/bold green]

This Master Non-Commercial Software License Agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into between Alzheimer’s Disease Data Initiative, Inc. (“ADDI”) and the entity named below (“Licensee”) effective as of the date of the last of the two signatures below (the “Effective Date”).
Whereas, ADDI has developed certain software designed for use in federated data sharing applications; and
Whereas, Licensee desires to obtain a non-exclusive license to use the FDSA Software solely to perform the Approved Project (defined below), and ADDI is willing to grant such license on the terms and conditions set forth herein.
Now, therefore, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants stated below, the parties hereby agree as follows:

[bold green]DEFINITIONS[/bold green]
1.1 “Approved Project” means the non-commercial, academic or research project proposed by Licensee, and approved by ADDI, for use of the FDSA Software, as set forth in Exhibit A.
1.2 “Designated Environment” means a network environment owned or controlled by Licensee or Licensed Users.
1.3 “Documentation” means any applicable user guides, documentation, wikis, or other similar resources made available by or on behalf of ADDI (including through its website) with respect to the installation, configuration, management, and use of the FDSA Software.
1.4 “FDSA APIs” means ADDI’s application programming interfaces, as well as other commands or instructions provided by ADDI under this Agreement, that allow other software products to communicate with or call on the FDSA Software.
1.5 “FDSA Software” means ADDI’s proprietary computer program known as the “federated data sharing appliance.” “FDSA Software” includes: (i) the federated data sharing appliance; (ii) associated FDSA APIs; (iii) any software development kit software or other similar materials that may be delivered hereunder; and (iv) any Updates thereto hereafter furnished to Licensee by ADDI under this Agreement.
1.6 “Integrated Application” means independent application software that integrates with the FDSA Software through the FDSA APIs.
1.7 “Licensed Users” means Licensee’s employees who reasonably need access to use the FDSA Software for the Approved Project.
1.8 “Permissive License” means the Apache license (available at https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), BSD license (available at https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause), MIT license (available at https://opensource.org/licenses/MITlicenses), Creative Commons Attribution License (CC-BY) (available at https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/), or, with advance written approval from ADDI, another permissive open source software license.
1.9 “Third-Party Licensee” means a third party to whom ADDI has licensed the FDSA Software for an Approved Project.
1.10 “Updates” means updates to the FDSA Software provided to Licensee hereunder, such as bug fixes, security patches, and similar changes to the FDSA Software.

[bold green]LICENSE[/bold green]
2.1 Software License. Subject to Licensee’s ongoing compliance with this Agreement, ADDI hereby grants to Licensee a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable and non-sublicensable (except as expressly provided herein), license during the Term (defined below) to allow the Licensed Users to (i) install and use the FDSA Software on the Designated Environment solely in furtherance of the Approved Project and solely in accordance with the Documentation, and (ii) to use any Documentation internally in conjunction with the Approved Project. The licenses granted by ADDI hereunder are granted on a royalty-free basis, but ADDI reserves the right to charge for ADDI products and services (including the FDSA Software) in the future, in its sole discretion.
2.2 Third Party Software. The FDSA Software may be provided with certain open-source software and other third party software components (“Third Party Materials”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Licensee’s use of Third Party Materials is governed by separate terms as set forth in APPENDIX B, and the limitations and restrictions set forth in this Agreement shall not apply if and to the extent such limitations and restrictions are impermissible pursuant to the applicable third-party license terms applicable to such Third Party Materials.
2.3 Restrictions. Licensee shall not, directly or indirectly, and shall not authorize any person, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law or third party license, to (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer or attempt to reconstruct or discover any source code, algorithms, architecture or other elements of; (ii) translate, adapt, or modify; (iii) write or develop any program based upon except as expressly provided in Section 2.4; (iv) use for benchmarking or ‘service bureau’ purposes; (v) sell, sublicense, transfer, or otherwise assign or grant to a third party any rights in; (vi) allow access to unauthorized persons to; or (vii) otherwise use except as expressly permitted hereunder and as provided in any applicable Documentation, in each case of (i) – (vii), the FDSA Software.
2.4 Integrated Application Development. Notwithstanding the restrictions set forth in Section 2.3, Licensee may develop Integrated Applications (solely in accordance with the applicable FDSA API Documentation); provided that, as a condition of authorizing such development and the use of the FDSA APIs and related Documentation to enable such development, Licensee:
(a) is required to offer the Integrated Applications to any Third-Party Licensee under the same terms Licensee receives access to the FDSA Software hereunder (as if the project for which such Third-Party Licensee was approved to use the software was an Approved Project) or under a Permissive License;
(b) will make copies of all Integrated Applications available to ADDI as reasonably requested by ADDI; and
(c) hereby grants ADDI a nonexclusive, worldwide, royalty free, fully paid up, right and license to distribute, create derivative works of, and license the Integrated Applications, and derivatives thereof, (i) to Third-Party Licensees on the same terms ADDI makes the FDSA Software available to such Third-Party Licensees, and (ii) in connection with any of ADDI’s products or services that ADDI offers for free, on the same terms ADDI makes available such other products or services for free. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing grant does not (unless Licensee elects to provide its Integrated Applications to ADDI pursuant to a Permissive License) permit ADDI to sell commercial licenses to the Integrated Applications, but ADDI may refer requests for commercial licenses directly to Licensee.
ADDI will provide Licensee with reasonable attribution in connection with the Integrated Applications pursuant in a manner consistent with the manner it provides attribution to other similarly situated third parties, and, where applicable, in accordance with the attribution requirements of the applicable Permissive License.
2.5 Reporting. Licensee shall provide to ADDI all information regarding Licensee’s use of the FDSA Software and Documentation as reasonably requested by ADDI from time to time, including such information as may be reasonably necessary to verify compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

[bold green]OWNERSHIP[/bold green]
3.1 Reservation of Rights. As between ADDI and Licensee, (a) ADDI hereby retains all rights, title and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the FDSA Software, which is licensed and not sold, and (b) Licensee retains all rights, including intellectual property rights, in and to its own independently developed software, including its Integrated Applications. As a condition of the licenses granted herein, Licensee must retain all copyright and other attribution legends on all copies of the FDSA Software.
3.2 Feedback. To the extent that Licensee provides ADDI with any information, suggestions, bug reports or fixes, ideas for enhancements or modifications, or other feedback regarding the features and performance of the FDSA Software (collectively, “Feedback”), Licensee acknowledges that such Feedback is provided to ADDI on a non-confidential basis (regardless of any suggestion to the contrary in any accompanying communication), and ADDI and its successors and assigns will be entitled to use Feedback in the further development and commercialization of its products and services. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, source code implementing Integrated Applications does not constitute Feedback, but the general nature of, and information regarding the features and functionality of (and associated implementation methodologies) of the Integrated Applications shall be deemed to constitute Feedback.
3.3 Usage Data. Licensee agrees that ADDI may collect information related to Licensee’s use of and interaction with the FDSA Software, which may include log data and an identification of Licensee’s devices, systems, application software and peripherals (collectively, “Usage Data”), and ADDI may use, analyze, compile, and otherwise exploit such Usage Data to provide, support, enhance and otherwise facilitate the development and improvement of the FDSA Software and any other ADDI products and services now or hereafter developed, provided that the foregoing is not a license to disclose Usage Data in raw, disaggregated, or non-deidentified form, or to identify Licensee as the source of any Usage Data or conclusions drawn in whole or in part from the Usage Data.

[bold green]TERM AND TERMINATION[/bold green]
4.1 Term. This Agreement will start on the Effective Date and, unless terminated earlier in accordance with this Agreement, will remain in effect for a term of one (1) year; thereafter, this Agreement will automatically renew for additional one (1) year periods subject, however, to the right of either party to terminate this Agreement prior to the start of any such renewal term upon thirty (30) days’ written notice to the other party (the initial term, along with any renewal term, the “Term”).
4.2 Termination. Either party may terminate this Agreement for convenience upon 30 days’ prior written notice to the other party. Additionally, ADDI may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice if: (i) Licensee is in material breach of this Agreement, which is not cured within 30 days after written notice of such breach; (ii) Licensee is no longer a member of, affiliated with, or actively participating in an Approved Project, (iii) Licensee ceases to operate or files for bankruptcy or similar protection; or (iv) if Licensee initiates any claim that the FDSA Software, or any portion thereof, infringes any of Licensee’s intellectual property rights.
4.3 Effect of Termination. Upon the effective date of expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason, Licensee must promptly return or certify to the destruction of all tangible embodiments of Confidential Information (including deleting all instances of the FDSA Software from Licensee systems), and all rights and licenses granted to Licensee hereunder will terminate immediately. All definitions and the following provisions will survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason: Sections 1, 3, 4.3, 5, 6, 7 and 8.

[bold green]CONFIDENTIALITY[/bold green]
5.1 Definition. “Confidential Information” means any information disclosed by ADDI that is (i) designated as “confidential,” or in some other manner to indicate its confidential nature, or (ii) otherwise would reasonably expected to be treated in a confidential nature under the circumstances of disclosure or by the nature of the information itself. Without limiting the foregoing, the FDSA Software and the terms (but not the existence) of this Agreement are Confidential Information, but Confidential Information does not include any information which Licensee can reasonably demonstrate (a) is or becomes generally known and available to the public through no act or omission of Licensee; (b) was already in Licensee’s possession without restriction at the time of disclosure; (c) is lawfully obtained by Licensee on a non-confidential basis from a third party who has the express right to make such disclosure; or (d) is independently developed by Licensee without use of, or reference to (and by persons who did not have access to), the Confidential Information.
5.2 Limited Use; Maintenance. Licensee will not provide, disclose or otherwise make available Confidential Information to any person other than Licensed Users having need to use the FDSA Software in conjunction with use of the Designated Environment for the Approved Project as provided by the license granted in Section 2 above. Licensee may not use the FDSA Software except as expressly provided in Section 2. Licensee will take reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of, and avoid disclosure and unauthorized use of, Confidential Information, and will take at least those measures that it takes to protect its own confidential information of similar nature.
5.3 Compelled Disclosure. If Licensee is compelled by law or a court of competent jurisdiction to disclose Confidential Information, it will promptly notify ADDI in writing and will cooperate in seeking a protective order or other appropriate remedy limiting such disclosure. If disclosure is ultimately required, Licensee will furnish only that portion of Confidential Information that it is legally required to disclose and will exercise reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that it will receive confidential treatment.
INDEMNIFICATION. Licensee will (i) defend, or at its option settle, any claim brought against ADDI and its affiliates by a third party relating to (a) any data provided or made available by or on behalf of Licensee, (b) Licensee’s violation of this Agreement, or (c) Licensee’s use of the FDSA Software, and (ii) pay any damages awarded in a final judgment, or amounts agreed in a monetary settlement, in any such claim defended by Licensee. ADDI will provide Licensee (x) prompt written notice of, (y) sole control over the defense and settlement of, and (z) all information and assistance reasonably requested by Licensee in connection with the defense or settlement of, any such claim.

[bold green]DISCLAIMER; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY [/bold green]
7.1 Disclaimer. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE FDSA SOFTWARE AND SUPPORT SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS-IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY. ADDI HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT AND ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING. ADDI DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE TECHNOLOGY WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR WILL WORK WITHOUT INTERRUPTIONS.
7.2 No Support. Licensee is solely responsible for installing and operating the FDSA Software, and for maintaining the Designated Environment. During the Term, ADDI may, but has no obligation to, provide technical support for the FDSA Software as reasonably requested by Licensee (“Support Services”).
7.3 Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT WILL ADDI BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, TREBLE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF BUSINESS, REVENUE, PROFITS, GOODWILL, DATA OR OTHER ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, HOWEVER CAUSED AND BASED ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF LICENSEE IS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. ADDI’S TOTAL LIABILITY (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS’ FEES) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED USD$100. THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED OR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY.

[bold green]GENERAL PROVISIONS[/bold green]
8.1 Assignment. Licensee may not assign or delegate this Agreement, in whole or in part, or any right or obligation arising hereunder, without the prior written consent of ADDI. For purposes of the foregoing, an assignment includes a merger involving Licensee (regardless of which party survives the transaction), a change of control of Licensee, a sale of all or substantially all Licensee’s stock or assets, an assignment to an affiliate of Licensee or in connection with Licensee’s internal reorganization, and an assignment by operation of law. ADDI may assign this Agreement to any successor to all or substantially all of ADDI’s assets related to this Agreement, whether by way of sale of stock or assets, merger, change of control, or otherwise. Any assignment in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties’ respective successors and permitted assigns.
8.2 Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable for any failure or delay in its performance under this Agreement due to any cause beyond its reasonable control, including without limitation an act of war, terrorism, act of God, earthquake, flood, embargo, riot, sabotage, labor shortage or dispute, governmental act, hacker attack, or failure of the Internet. The delayed party shall give the other party notice of such cause and shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to correct such failure or delay in performance.
8.3 Audit Rights. Licensee shall maintain complete and accurate records of its use of the FDSA Software during the Term and for 2 years thereafter. Upon 10 days’ written notice, and no more than once per calendar year, Licensee shall provide ADDI with reasonable access to Licensee’s premises during normal business hours to conduct an audit of Licensee’s records and systems to verify compliance with this Agreement, including without limitation, verification regarding any restrictions on use of the FDSA Software. ADDI shall bear the costs of any such audit, except that if Licensee is found to have violated the terms of this Agreement, in addition to any and all remedies available to ADDI in law or equity, Licensee shall reimburse ADDI for all reasonable audit expenses.
8.4 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of Washington without reference to conflict of laws principles. The application of the United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. All disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in King County, Washington, and the parties hereby agree and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of these courts. If Licensee breaches or threatens to breach the provisions of Sections 2.1, 2.3, 2.4, or 5, Licensee agrees that ADDI will have no adequate remedy at law and is therefore entitled to seek immediate injunctive and other equitable relief, without bond and without the necessity of showing actual money damages.
8.5 Miscellaneous. This Agreement (together with all Exhibits hereto) is the sole agreement of the parties concerning the subject matter hereof, and it supersedes all prior agreements and understandings with respect to said subject matter. No terms of any purchase order, acknowledgement or other form provided by Licensee will modify this Agreement, regardless of any failure of ADDI to object to such terms. Any ambiguity in this Agreement shall be interpreted equitably without regard to which party drafted hereof. This Agreement may only be amended by a writing signed by both parties. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts. The headings in this Agreement are inserted for convenience and are not intended to affect the interpretation of this Agreement. Any required notice shall be given in writing by customary means with receipt confirmed at the address of each party set forth below, or to such other address as either party may substitute by written notice to the other, with an email copy to the emails below. Notices will be deemed to have been given at the time of actual delivery in person, 1 day after delivery to an overnight courtier service, or 3 days after deposit in the U.S. mail. The relationship between the parties shall be that of independent contractors. Waiver of any term of this Agreement or forbearance to enforce any term by either party shall not constitute a waiver as to any subsequent breach or failure of the same term or a waiver of any other term of this Agreement. Any provision found to be unlawful, unenforceable or void shall be severed from the remainder of this Agreement, and the Agreement will continue in full force and effect without said provision. Licensee agrees to comply with all applicable export control laws and regulations related to its use of the FDSA Software.
